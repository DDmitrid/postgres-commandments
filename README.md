Short axioms about how to use Postgres.

<details>
  <summary>Disclaimer</summary>
  
  - These are not recommendations from the official PostgreSQL community.
  
  - They are my personal observations based on my own experience as PostgreSQL DBA for the past 10 years.
  
  - You can follow or ignore them but the main course of these commandments - prioritise data safety over performance.

#

Avoid long transactions.

Avoid idle transactions.

Don't disable autovacuum.

Don't use 'fsync=off' in production.

Don't remove anything from $DATADIR.

<details>
  <summary>Don't use 'kill -9' against Postgres processes.</summary>

PostgreSQLâ€™s official documentation states:
It is best not to use SIGKILL to shut down the server. Doing so will prevent the server from releasing shared memory and semaphores, which might then have to be done manually before a new server can be started. (quote end)
Moreover, using SIGKILL against even a single Postgres backend forces to immediately terminate all other backends, re-initialize internal structures and run recovery from last check point, at which database cluster is not available for clients and applications until recovery ends.

In the example below, you can see how Postgres handles SIGKILL:
1) Process with PID 9774 is terminated by SIGKILL.
2) Postgres terminates the rest of its processes (20 processes in total).
3) Reinitializes and runs automatic recovery process (which may take a while in various scenarios).
4) Finishes recovery and starts accepting connections. (edited)

Don't delete rows by billions at a time.

Avoid creating unnecessary indexes.

The  more indexes table has, the slower you can write into it.

Don't use 'listen_addresses = *' on hosts with public access.

Use connection pooler when there are too many connections.

Postgres doesn't 'hang' at shutdown... It has *checkpoint*.

Don't use minor releases that are less than 3, in production.

VACUUM FULL completely blocks access to the table.

Use CONCURRENTLY as much as possible.

The bigger the table, the slower the count(*).

Hot standby != backup.

Don't trust non-validated backup.

Use partitioning for archived data.

Upstream and master candidate should be the same.

Don't re-invent queues, use PgQ.

Keep logs outside of $DATADIR.
